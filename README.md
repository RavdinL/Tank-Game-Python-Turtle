# Tank-Game-Python-Turtle
A little game about tanks like dendy using only Turtle library
This project uses Turtle library to draw game from pixels. 
Code is written in Object Oriented style, using some classes. 
Also there are many different functions to draw and to calculate game things.
Game is for two players, so there is blue and red team.
There are some items on the map that players can peak up: 
black - ammo item, red - damage increasing item, green - health increasing item.
Also used random library to do random generation of different items on the map.
Dont push buttons very fast or game will lag because turtle is so slow :)
